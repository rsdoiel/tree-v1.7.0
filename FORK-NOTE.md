This is a fork for Steve Baker's **tree** command (v1.7.0) obtained 
from http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/. I've made the fork
because I will surely forget that the homepage is at Indiana State.
I've made a minor tweak to the Makefile so I think a little
less when I install this on a Mac...
